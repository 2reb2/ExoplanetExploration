# ExoplanetExploration
Part of my NASA SPACE APPS CHALLENGE 2024's submission. After completing successfully the quiz, users will be directed to this web page to create their own Exoplanet.

### What this web page can do
1. Customise your own Exoplanet based on 4 parameters: size, color, texture, and cloud visibility.
2. Take a screenshot of the customised Exoplanet and name it by pressing 'Save Exoplanet settings'. The screenshot will then be downloaded to your own local machine.
